## FAQ
* I'm still using YouTube's old layout desgin, can I use this extension?  
  No. Please switch to the new desgin [here](https://www.youtube.com/new)  
  
* What is the difference between "Channel ID" and "Channel Name"  
  Channel names on YouTube are not unique and can be duplicated/changed  
  whereas Channel ID is a unique identification string that never changes.  
  If you want to block a specific single channel the preferred method is using it's ID,  
  If you want to block multiple channels sharing similar name use it's name.

* How can I get a channel's ID?  
  Channel ID looks like this: UCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  
  To get it, simply browse to a channel page and look at the URL `/channel/UCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`  
  If the URL is `/user/BadChannelExample` use [This site](https://vabs.github.io/youtube-channel-name-converter/) to convert the username to the channel ID

* How to block comments from specific user?  
  Blocked channels comments are removed as well, so just add the user's name/channel ID
  to your filters

* What is the behaviour when browsing blocked channel?  
  User will be redirected to YouTube homepage.

* What is the behaviour when browsing blocked video?  
  You can choose between two options:
  - Block the entire page and leave a custom message
  - Auto redirect user to the next video

* How can I ensure this extension cannot be bypassed?   
  TODO
  
## Future work

* Sync options to cloud provider / enterprise policies
* ~~Context menu helper~~ Done
* Whitelist mode
* YouTube Gaming support
* Dynamic rules (match multiple rules to block a video)
